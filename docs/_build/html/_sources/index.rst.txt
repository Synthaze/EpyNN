Welcome to EpyNN's documentation!
=================================

**EpyNN is written in pure Python/NumPy.**

In you use EpyNN in academia, please cite:

What is EpyNN?
--------------------

EpyNN is a production-ready but first Educational python resource for Neural Networks. EpyNN is designed for Supervised Machine Learning (SML) approaches in classification tasks by means of Neural Networks.

EpyNN includes **scalable**, **minimalistic** and **homogeneous** implementations of major Neural Network architectures in **pure Python/Numpy**. Because EpyNN is meant to be **educational**, it contains several dummy and real world examples of problems in dedicated directory from specific input processing scheme to generic pipeline from training to prediction.


Do I need EpyNN?
--------------------

EpyNN is intended for **teachers**, **students**, **scientists**, or more generally anyone with minimal skills in Python programming **who wish to understand** and build from basic implementations of NN architectures.

Although EpyNN can be used for production, it is meant to be a library of **homogeneous architecture templates** and **practical examples** which is expected to save an important amount of time for people who wish to learn, teach or **develop from scratch**, by themselves.
